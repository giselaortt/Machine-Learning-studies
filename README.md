# Intro:

ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸English:

Project was done with educational purposes. Reimplementing algorithms from scratch and adding class notes.

ython, para evitar cÃ³pias diretas do cÃ³digo e me concentrar na abstraÃ§Ã£o dos algorÃ­timos.


# Implemented :
- bam
- DWNN (distanced weighted nearest neighboors)
- KNN (k-nearest neighboors)
- MLP (multilayer perceptron)
- naive bayes
- k-means

# To be implemented:
- Decision Trees
- SVM (suport vector machine)
- RBF (radial basis function)
- multinomial naive bayes
- Swarm Particle Optimization

- I reeimplement the projects of this [youtube chanel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMSGXqLEE1q5NqG3hjA5vCg). Please take a look at the machine learning playlist. The classes belong to Rodrigo Mello, and where originally coded in R. I changed the language to python, to avoid direct copying.
